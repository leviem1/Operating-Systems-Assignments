* Test read page fault handling and quota handling

* Allocate some pages (no page faults yet)
8       quota
ffc000  fill  00  4000
ffc000  dup   400000 4000
400000  dup   754000 4000

75dcba  set   00
754000  dup   af8000 c000
b00000  fill  00  4000
* Each of the following lines should generate a read Page Fault
1000000 cmp  ffc000 1
b04000  cmp  754000 4001
403ff8  print 10
* Test that dup completes up to a read page fault
* (dup read page faults, set, print, and fill should succeed)
75fffe  set a2 b3
b03ffc  fill c4 4
b03ff0  print 10
75fffe  dup b03ff0 4
* This print statement should page fault after 10 bytes
b03ff0  print 20
* Test that cmp completes up to a read page fault. The next line should
* generate one mismatch and then a read page fault.
400208  cmp b03fff 8
* The next line should cause the process to terminate with quota exceeded
b040ff  set 00
* end of trace
